<h1>Build a Game with Javascript</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use Javascript to complete key functions to run a hot and cold app.</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions for challenges on the ReadMe and in the app.js file.</li>
  <li>All the code you'll write will be on the app.js file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building your game</h2>

<p><b>Step 1: Creating a random number.</b> The first thing we need for our application to work is a target number. Write a function that returns a random number. For this you'll need to declare a function, then return the value using a randomization equation. For help with that, you can check out this Javascript documentation on the function <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random">Math.random</a>.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Assigning your random number to a variable.</b> Once you've got your random number function working, we need to put it somewhere. Declare a variable and set the value of that variable as the random number you generate with the function you just wrote.</p> 
<p><b>Step 3: Checking the user's guess.</b> Finally, we need a function that checks whether or not the user's guess matches the randomly generated number. Fill in the rest of this declared function with an if/else statement that gives feedback to the user on whether or not they got the right number.</p>
